# Auto-Reba-Masters-Degree-Project
Live ergonomics in VR: I integrate Motion Capture (OptiTrack) with Unity, compute REBA angles on anatomical planes in real time, and deliver a calm HUD to Meta Quest Pro. Focus: robust sensor pipeline, low latency, clear UI. Use cases: training, onboarding, prevention.
